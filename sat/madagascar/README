Compilation:
   Choose between M, Mp and MpC by commenting/uncommenting the lines for
   VERSION and EXECUTABLE in Makefile
   make

The command line for the executables consist of a number of options and
the names of input file names. With an empty command line you get the list
of options together with information on the default configuration.

MpC often consumes all available memory, so it is critical to make sure that
-m N flag is set sensibly. Too high values lead to paging, and too low values
may mean that plans are not found. The default can be adjusted in main.c as
the default value of the flagMemoryLimit variable.
